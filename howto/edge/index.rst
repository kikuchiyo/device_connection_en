Managing EnOS Edge devices
=========================

You can use EnOS™ Edge to ingest data from on-site devices or 3rd party systems to the EnOS Cloud. As the front end of the EnOS Cloud, EnOS Edge extends the data ingestion capability through supporting various *communication protocol* and providing *device templates* to bridge the heterogeneous actual measuring points and the common device models.

Key Concepts
---------------

Device Template
``````````````````

A device template is the adapter between a common device model and a specific model of the device. A device template allows mapping between a specific device measuring point and a common device model.

Based on industrial experiences, EnOS has accumulated a number of device templates for reusing. You can also define customized device templates.

Communication Protocol
`````````````````````````

Communication protocol is a common phrase used in energy industry. EnOS Edge provides a rich protocol library that contains common protocols of energy and power industry, such as modbus, IEC104, OPCDA, OPCUA, and OPC-XML-DA. In addition, EnOS supports conventions of the major device manufacturers in the industry. For more information, see `Protocols Supported by EnOS Edge <https://docs.eniot.io/docs/enos-edge/en/latest/edge_specification/data_ingestion.html>`__ .

With these protocols, you can search and select desired protocols in the device template, which can be directly used after simple configuration  to avoid development or integration of protocols.
