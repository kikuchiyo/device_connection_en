# Creating an Asset Tree and Node

This article describes how to create an asset tree and bind an asset to the asset tree.

## Before You Start

To create an asset tree, you must have write access to the **Asset Tree** service. If you don't have the access, contact your OU administrator to obtain the access. For more information about user access in EnOS, see [Policy, Roles, and Access](/docs/iam/en/latest/access_policy).

## Creating an Asset Tree

1. In the EnOS Console, click **Asset Tree** from the left side navigation panel.

2. Click  **+**  on the upper left corner to create an asset tree.

3. In the **Create Asset Tree** window, provide the following settings:

   - **Name**: Enter the asset tree name.
   - **Select Model**: Select a model for the tree from the drop-down list.
     If the asset tree does not need a model, you can use the built-in model `None`, which has four empty elements.
   - **Timezone/City**: Select the timezone or city for the asset tree.
   - If you selected a model, provide corresponding attribute values ​​according to the specifications defined in the thing model.

## Binding a Device to Asset Tree
