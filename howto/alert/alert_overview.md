# Alert Management Overview

The EnOS Asset Alert Management service enables you to define, receive, and process alerts for your organization assets. The service also allows you to define alert triggering rules against the asset data, to achieve real-time alarming and troubleshooting.

## Key Concepts

An _alert_ is a record generated by the system when the value of a measuring point in a certain domain reaches a specific condition.

The condition that triggers the alert is the _alert rule_. What's generated by the system is the _alert content_. As measuring points or alerts may vary, to distinguish and manage the alerts more effectively, alerts on EnOS are typically classified based on the _severity_ (such as danger, critical, error, warning, and information) and _type_ (such as over-limit).

The alert management message flow and the key concepts are illustrated in the following figure:

## Major Functions

**Forward alert data to EnOS in a standard data structure**

The alert management service defines standard alert data structure and alert receiving interfaces to allow alert data to be transmitted to EnOS cloud at the real-time or in batch processing mode. For the EnOS cloud to be able to process the alert data, you must use the Alert Management service to define the standard alert data structure that is accepted by EnOS.

**Support defining alert triggering rules and generated content**

The Alert Management service allows you to define alert triggering rules for specific data measuring points of a domain. For example, you can define an over-limit rule which triggers an alert when the value of the measuring point exceeds a threshold.

For devices such as wind turbines, photovoltaic inverter, and booster stations, you can define alert triggering rules for data acquisition points, for example, when the engine room temperature exceeds 45 degrees centigrade, or when a short-circuit occurs in the booster station, to meet the real-time monitoring requirements, subsequent diagnosis, and troubleshooting requirements.

Meanwhile, you can define alert severity levels and alert types according to the best practices of a domain. For example, you can define alert types such as communication abnormality and performance degrading. You can also define the typical alert severities: information, warning, and error according to your business requirements.

**Support query, subscription, push alert data from EnOS**

Alert Management service provides APIs for alert data related actions such as querying, subscribing, and pushing alerts. You can develop your own alarming applications or perform analytics based on these APIs. By subscribing to alerts and integrating with email service or message service, you can also develop your own alarming applications such as alert pop-ups, real-time and historical alert inquiry, and email and message alerts.

**Support integrating 3rd-party alert data**

EnOS can also accept alert data that are generated from third-party systems. For example, in the ship-building industry, the on-site SCADA can forward the alert data received from the ship communication network to EnOS in a standard alert data format. You can then use EnOS alert management service APIs for your alert related applications.

.. note:: For assets connected through MQTT, alerts are not generated by default even after you configure the alert triggering rules for the assets. To generate alerts for such assets, the alert engine must be configured. Contact your Envision project manager or system administrator for alert engine configuration requests.
