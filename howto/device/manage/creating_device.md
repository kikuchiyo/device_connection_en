# Creating a Device

A device is an instance of a model. It belongs to a certain product. A DeviceKey, a unique certificate within the organization, will be issued by the platform for the device. The device can be connected directly to the platform or connected to the IoT platform as a sub-device via edge. This topic describes how to create a device.

## Before You Start

- To register a device, you must have write access to the **Connectivity Management** service. If you don't have the access, contact your OU administrator to obtain the access. For more information about user access in EnOS, see [Policy, Roles, and Access](/docs/iam/en/latest/access_policy).

- The product to which the device belongs has been created. For information about how to create a product, see [Creating a Product](creating_product).

## Step 1: Creating a Device

1. In the EnOS Console, select **Device Management > Device**.

2. Click the **New Device** button and complete the following settings on the **New Device** pop-up window.

   - **Product**: Select the product to which the device belongs. After selecting the product, continue to configure the Attributes settings in the template of the product. Attributes are either required or optional.
   - **Device Name**: The name of the device; same name can be used under the same organization.
   - **Use DST**: Use daylight saving time, the time zone is city.
   - **timezone**: Refers to the local time of a region or a country to select timezone.
   - **Device Key**: A unique identifier for the product under the same organization. If not provided, the system will generate a device key. When self-defined, supports uppercase alphabets (A-Z), lowercase alphabets (a-z), numbers (0-9), dash "-" and underline.
   - Model-defined features: The features that are defined by the device model, when a feature is set to required in the model, you must provide the setting when registering the device. The optional features can be added after the device is registered.

3. Click **Confirm** to create the product.

## Step 2: (Optional) Adding a Tag

A tag describes the common information shared by all instances of the device.

1. From the list of created devices, find the target device and click **View**.

2. Under the **Basic Information** tab, click **Edit** in the **Tags** section.

3. On the pop-up window, click **New tag**, and enter the key-value pair (key:value) for the new tag.

4. Click **OK** to save the tag.

## Results

After creating the device, you will obtain a set of credentials: Device Name (`deviceName`) and Device Secret (`deviceSecret`). The device secret credential issued by EnOS Cloud will be used to activate the device. For more information, see [Device and Cloud Security](../../../learn/deviceconnection_authentication).

## Follow-up Operations

When offline, the status of the newly created device is shown as Inactive. To activate the device, you will need to initiate a connection through the device SDK. For more information, see [EnOS SDK Overview](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/app-development/en/latest/sdk_overview.html)
