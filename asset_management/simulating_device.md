# Simulating devices

EnOS™ provides the device simulator to help you simulate device data transmission.

## Step 1: Add a simulator.

1. Click **Asset Management > Device Simulator** from the left navigation.

2. Select the device to be simulated.

3. Set up a model for the device.

## Step 2: Define the simulator sample

After the simulated device is added, define the simulation sample for the device.

You can download a sample template from EnOS™ and fill in the data according to the format of the template.

The figure shows the simulation of the `INV.Freq` point. The simulator will read the time in your sample to simulate the current value.

## Step 3: Start the simulator

You can set the end time when you start up the simulator.


## Step 4: Preview the simulation data

After you start the simulator, you can use the **Asset Management > Data Preview** function to view the data generated by the simulator, or click **View** in the device simulator screen to view historical trends and details.
