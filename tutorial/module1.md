# Module 1. Applying for cloud Edge

In this lab, the trainer will apply for the cloud edge in advance. You will apply for a cloud Edge serial number from the trainer for
subsequent registration on the EnOS cloud.

This module requires only the serial number of the cloud edge. Device registration is performed during EnOS™ cloud configuration.
