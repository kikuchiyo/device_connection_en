Cover page description: Learn how to connect a smart device to EnOS and simulate uploading data using EnOS SDK for Java.

Overview page:

The first thing you start to do on an IoT platform is to connect your devices and data. This tutorial walks you through registering a smart device on the EnOS Cloud, performing device-end development, connecting the device to EnOS Cloud, and simulating data transmission through Java program.

This tutorial is the basic learning module you need to complete first.


Tutorial Overview: Learning how to connect a simulated device into EnOS.
Unit 1: Mapping the physical attributes of the device to the digital world by creating a model, a product, and a device on EnOS Console.
Unit 2: Connecting the device to EnOS Cloud directly by using EnOS Device SDK for MQTT for Java.
Unit 3: Simulating telemetry data of a measuring point and posting the data to the cloud.
Unit 4: Sending commands to control device status with the defined service.
Unit 5: Monitoring the health and performance of the device by the setting alerts.
Unit 6. Monitoring the device state and data on EnOS Console.
